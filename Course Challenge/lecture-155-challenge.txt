ok so its now time just for a mini challenge we have another challenge to will be coming up in a later video but for this one now looking at the code what why did I actually declare loc file at the start of the method that's the code that its on line 19 why did I declare it there's instead of saying coming into here on line  21 and doing something like file writer....and doing it their and obviously we got an error here because we already defined it but what's the reason that I chose to put it in here on line 19 instead of actually doing it within the try block so have a think about that and if you know the reason well when you figure out the reason come back and un-pause the video and I'll show you or tell you what it is
